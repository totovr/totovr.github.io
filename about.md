## About

Hello! I'm Antonio Vega Ramirez, current master student in Hiroshima University.

Originally from Guanajuato, Antonio received a BA in Telecommunications and Electronics
engineering from Guanajuato University. I'm working under the supervision of
Professor [Yuichi Kurita](http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~kurita/cal.html) in the
developing of new soft exoskeletons and human augmentation technology.
