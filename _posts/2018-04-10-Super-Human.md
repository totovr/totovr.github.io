Physical activities are highly significant in maintaining a healthy life. However, with increased dependency on automated systems, our lifestyle is becoming more and more desk-bound, making us prone to multiple health-related difficulties such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancers. To tackle such issues, we must introduce innovative ideas for integrating technology with exercise techniques that can implement sports, fun, and physical stimulation. Our team proposes a paintball game by integrating multiple ideas of human-augmentation. The players are divided into two equal-numbered teams. Each player has a laser gun attached to their right forearm. The laser gun is accompanied by a set of pneumatic artificial muscles to provide a feeling of force-feedback to the user. Players will have a special weapon, an infrared (IR) gun with a broader range, that can be used to target opposite players, effortlessly. On the players' left arm; an electromyographic sensor is attached. This sensor is used as a charging device, to be able to use the IR gun. All players can track their progress on a visual interface attached to their right arm. This game can be played by all individuals irrespective of their age, and provide new value of the sports.
