SimpleOpenni is a wrapper of Nite and OpenNI coded by Max Rheiner, the detail here
is that since OpenNI was
[bought](https://apple.slashdot.org/story/14/03/02/1530202/apple-closes-openni-the-open-source-kinect-framework)
by Apple the website was shoot down in April of 2013. Anyway last days I have
been using Kinect V1 with SimpleOpenNI in my Mac for some projects,
but since my professor suggest me to try to migrate to Kinect V2 to have a better
performance, I know that also Kinect V2 is discontinued but is still been a great
and cheap IR projector and sensor, I could successfully set it up in my Mac using the
[libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) and some dependencies
that also use this driver.
